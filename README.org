#+Title: The ORGJS-Wrapper
* ORGJS-Wrapper
ORG-JS Wrapper is Javascript wrapper around some preexisting Javascript libraries that can render [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/org-mode][org]]-files with embedded objects of various types.

Main rendering is done by [[https://github.com/mooz/org-js][org.js]], then embedded objects are rendered/animated.

** Features include:

- Renders embedded [[https://www.graphviz.org/][Graphviz]] with [[https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/][viz.js]]
- Renders Math markup with [[https://www.mathjax.org/][MathJax]]
- All tables are sortable, and can be rotated clientside
- Various print output options with runtime-chooseable CSS-hacks.
- Syntax highlighting for several languages
- Output is cached compressed to speed up rendering on future loads
- Cleans the SVG a bit too
- Easily add interactivity and active datasources with Javascript embedded in the org
- Chapters can be hidden/shown depending on tags

** How to use:

- Clone repo
- copy Empty.org.htm to NewName.org.htm
- edit NewName.org.htm, and view in Browser
- Template.org.htm has more complete examples and explanation
- (No Emacs needed, but recommended)

** Also Uses:

- LZ-String from https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string
- tablesort from (i think) https://github.com/tristen/tablesort
- something called (iirc) vkbeautify

** Bugs:
On chrome, when calling from file:// urls:

- caching is disabled, because/when localstorage is not available.
- Using included files does not work because of CORS restrictions.

I'm uploading cleaned bits of this as I find time, so WIP.

(Note, I'll add links to the source repos for the used ones soon too)
